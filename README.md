This project contains a number of tools and libraries for emulating the Motorola
68000 chipset; used in devices like the Apple Macintosh, Sega Megadrive and
Commodore Amiga.

__WARNING__ This project is an incomplete work in progress.

The goal of this project is less about performance or competing with existing
emulators. It's more about enabling a better development and learning experience
for novices like me.
